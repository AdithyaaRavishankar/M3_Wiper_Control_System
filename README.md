# M3_Wiper_Control_System

# INTRODUCTION
This Wiper Speed Control System is utilised in all sorts of automobiles, and its primary function is to remove rain air drops from the vehicle's front screen. Because driving a vehicle in the rain is quite difficult, we will use wipers to clear the front screen of the vehicle, which is a mirror, so that we may drive the vehicle even in the rain.
